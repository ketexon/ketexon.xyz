To the light, the light passing through the slivers
Of white wood, passing through a
                        Triblade razor,
To the chirps of the birds, the twitters of the
Swallows, the mechanical alarms for a
                        Consummation to begin,
To the low rumble of the cars,
To the barking of the dogs and their
                        Inevitable response,
The eyes open,
The conscious starts,
The body takes its time to
                                    Warm up
To the cold breeze through the window,
The only evidence that time had passed
                                    At all.

And in its groggy boot,
It starts its procedure.
            Rise,
            Step,
            Step some more,
Turn into the mirrored room.
Observe.

The brown layers of waves
Atop a reddened beach of sand,
Dotted with grim grooves
            And blanched rocks.

The two curved bars
In their perfect inequality,
In their near (but not quite)
            Separation,
In their spoked texture.

The crescented moon
Aside the blue and black sky,
In a frame of barbs,
Above a shadowed terrain.

The caved-out mountain,
The dark cattail fields,
And in them a pair of
            Twins,
Fraternal, with skin
Of mudcracked clay.

To the moon, it looks,
And the moon returns
            The glance,
Transferring its finite power
Of infinite value
To control the tides
And unveil the sky.

A silence of ratification,
An accordance, finality,
A recognition of the joint
Brings pains and ease,
But most importantly,
The eternal pleasure
      Of certainty.

            Descend from the steeple,
Let the procedure continue,
            Grab a glass,
            Make a cup of
Bitter liquid,
      Without the worry
Of doing it yourself.
