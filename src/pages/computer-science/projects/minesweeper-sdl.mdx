I made [Minesweeper](https://github.com/ketexon/Minesweeper-SDL) using C17 with SDL! [Latest release](https://github.com/ketexon/Minesweeper-SDL/releases/latest).

Some of the cool features I added are:
 - Resize support
 - Embedded resources (WinAPI resources)
 - Customizable spritesheets using resources or at runtime (not in release)
 - A solver that uses matrices (very slow, need to rewrite) (not in release)
 - Lua scripting (WIP) (not in release, ignore the half-working code in main 😵‍💫)

Part of the point of using C is to see if I could do "object oriented C" (explicit `this` parameter). I think it worked well with my naming conventions (for struct `Struct`, a member function is `Struct_Function`), and the only thing now stopping me from using C for everything is lack of a good standard library 😭.

Credit goes to [my sister](https://www.instagram.com/junaxy_art/) for making the only other theme option.
