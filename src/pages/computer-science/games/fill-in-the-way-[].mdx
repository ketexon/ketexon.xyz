[Fill in The Way [     ]](https://jabenero.itch.io/fill-in-the-way-home) is a visual novel developed by Cult du Flop (UCLA ACM Team 6) for the 3 day long [SonderingEmily x Juliestrator jam](https://itch.io/jam/sonderingemily-juliestrator).

It is a fully-voiced visual novel made in Unity with YarnSpinner, where you fill in a scrapbook to create a story. There even is a secret ending!

I was in charge of programming, where I quickly integrated YarnSpinner with the over 100 lines of dialogue. This involved adding scripting capabilities with YarnSpinner to allow animations, sprite switching, and even some post-processing shader-work. This was definitely the smoothest game jam I have taken part in, and I give credit to the amazing team!

Something I learned in this project was how to add *voiced* dialogue to YarnSpinner. It was much easier than I thought, but still a good learning experience. I also made good use of YarnSpinner commands, which I knew of before but had not used to this extent. Another cool thing I did was implement drag-n-drop in Unity UI (much harder than I would have hoped).
